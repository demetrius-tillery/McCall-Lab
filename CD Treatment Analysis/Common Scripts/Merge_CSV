###This is good to use if needing to merge two columns based on a matching column. Useful for merging feature+meta data CSVs
import pandas as pd

#Load CSV files you want to combine
df1 = pd.read_csv('C8_heart_only_featuretable.csv')
df2 = pd.read_csv('C8_heart_only_metadata.csv')

print(df1)

print(df2)

#This fills the first CSV with data from the second CSV.

column_to_combine = 'sampleid' #Replace this name as needed

#Concats the two CSVs together based on the column, this can be repeated or made into a for loop for larger amounts of additions that need to be made.
combined_df = pd.merge(df2, df1, on='sampleid', how='outer')

print("Combined DataFrame:")
print(combined_df)

#Saves to a new CSV. Replace the name as needed.
combined_df.to_csv('C8_Heart_featuremeta.csv', index=False)
